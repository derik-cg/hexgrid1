Matlab code for simulating a random walk on a hex grid
The grid is a modified square grid of integer numbers
Then on even integers in the x axis, the y locations are decreased by 0.5.
Each node in the grid is assumed to be the center of a hex and the movement can be to any of the six positions.
The plotting device does not modify the output of the program. The modifications are local.
